## UX

The purpose of this project is to offer users a monthly, curated box of snacks and other products catered towards users who are following the ketogenic diet, or are looking to begin following the ketogenic diet. The service offers users the opportunity to discover new ketogenic snakcs, foods, or other suitable products which they may not have tried before or have previously been aware of. As the ketogenic diet can be quite limiting, this box offers users the chance to potentially widen their food intake or add some more variety to their diet. As with many other subscription box services, the cost of the box itself each month is less than the cost would be were the user to individually purchase all of the items featured in the box each month. Users can subscribe on a month to month basis, or on a three or six monthly basis for a slightly reduced average monthly cost than the month to month option.

Businesses who wish to stock their own keto-friendly products in the box could also see a benefit to themselves from this service as there is potential for their products and brand to be introduced to new clients, which in turn could create new, returning customers to their business if the clients like their products which are featured in the box.

The site itself allows for customers to customize their box contents to an extent. The contents of each month's box will always be unknown until the customer receives the box, however, the option is available for customers to input any dietary restrictions, allergies, or food intolerances upon the creation of their account via a small form with dropdown menus - this ensures customers are not receiving items which they cannot use in their box each month, or putting them at risk of exposure to allergens - these preferences will be saved for future reference along with the rest of the customer's information. These preferences can be updated at any time via the update account page.

The site also allows for purchases of individual items via a seperate online shop, where users can purchase items featured in past boxes as well as products which have not been featured in boxes at all. This allows users who do not wish to receive unknown items each month, or who perhaps cannot afford to pay for a monthly box to still browse and purchase keto products that they wish to try or that they know they will like. The store allows for users to filter products by their price, dietary restrictions, or by ingredients in order to filter out any products that contain potential allergens.

## User Stories
### User Story One:
As a newcomer to the keto diet, I would like to be able to discover a range of snacks which fit into my new diet, as finding keto-friendly snacks can be quite difficult. A subscription box would allow me to discover and sample new products every month, adding variety to my diet and opening me up to new brands and products which I may not have been previously aware of.

### User Story Two:
As a vegan on the keto diet, it often proves extremely difficult for me to find snacks in stores which are suitable for me to consume as most vegan snacks tend to be relatively high in carbohydrates. Rather than spending extended periods of time scouring the internet and researching what snacks are both vegan and keto-friendly, I would like to be able to simply input my dietary preferences and have a box of appropriate foods and snacks curated and shipped to me every month in order to remove a lot of unnecessary legwork on my end.

### User Story Three:
As somebody who follows the keto diet but lives in a rural area with little to no access to health food shops from which to purchase keto products, I would like to be able to find a range of products to suit my diet all in one place online and have them delivered to my door at a time that is convenient for me.

### Uer Story Four:
As a person who suffers from type 2 diabetes and has limited mobilty, my doctor has advised me to try out the keto diet to try and improve my health, however, it can be somewhat difficult for me to get out to the shops to find and purchase foods that are suitable for me to eat. A curated box of foods that has been put together to suit my dietary needs and that can be delivered to me at my home on a regular basis would be extremely helpful to me.

### User Story Five:
As a UK resident, I would like to be able to purchase one of the various keto subscription boxes available online, however none of these currently exisiting boxes ship to the UK as the companies are all US based and do not offer international shipping - I would like for there to be a UK equivalent of these boxes which I am able to purchase and enjoy.
